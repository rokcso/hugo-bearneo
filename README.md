# Hugo ‚ú® Bear Neo

> Free, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging.

[English](./README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./doc/README_zh.md)

üß∏ A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev).

Transplanted from [Hugo Bear Blog][hugo-bearblog], because the original author chose to maintain consistency with the root original [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev), so I chose to create a more extensible and feature-rich [Hugo Bear Blog][hugo-bearblog].

**Guidelines**

1. Continue to uphold the philosophy of [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev)
2. Ensure the ability to revert to configurations identical to [Hugo Bear Blog][hugo-bearblog] or even to [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) itself

For a current & working demo of this theme, please check out [https://rokcso.com/][rokcso-blog] üéØ.

## üìë User Manual

### Upvote post

First, refer to the [README](https://github.com/rokcso/post-upvote-api) documentation of the Post Upvote API to complete the deployment of the backend service.

> Using Cloudflare Workers + KV, deployment is simple and free.

Then add the following configuration to the Hugo blog configuration file `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params]
    upvote = true
    upvoteURL = "The domain name of the Worker that was just deployed/" 
```

Note: The `/` at the end of the URL must be included!

### Search post

Display a search box on the post list page and enter post title keywords to search for specific posts.

Add the following configuration to the Hugo blog configuration file `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params]
    postSearch = true
```

### Post list page grouped by year

Add the following configuration to the Hugo blog configuration file `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params]
    groupByYear = true
```

### Post page displays table of contents

Add the following configuration to the Hugo blog configuration file `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params]
    toc = true
```

### Follow App Claim

[Follow](https://follow.is/) is an RSS subscription tool. As a blog creator, claiming your blog on Follow allows you to receive $POWER tips from blog readers through Follow. I once wrote an [article](https://rokcso.com/p/follow-claim-feed-en/) explaining how to claim your blog on Follow.

The hugo-bearblog-neo natively supports the "Scheme III: RSS Tag" mentioned in my article. You only need to add the following configuration to the Hugo blog configuration file `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params]
    followFeedId = "00000000000000000"
    followUserId = "00000000000000000"
```

Note: Please remember to replace the Follow id in the configuration with your own!
